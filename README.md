# Human algorithm collaboration

This is supporting code for "Human-Algorithm Collaboration: Achieving Complementarity and Avoiding Unfairness". Note that all of the results in these papers are theoretical and so none of them strictly depend on the results in these notebooks. However, we did create code, especially for figures and illustrative examples. Hopefully, these notebooks will be useful for readers who wish to experiment with our area of study themselves.
